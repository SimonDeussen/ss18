Bootstrap you development environment simply with [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/). 

An easy example is documented here: [https://blog.versioneye.com/2015/05/05/setting-up-a-dev-environment-with-vagrant/](https://blog.versioneye.com/2015/05/05/setting-up-a-dev-environment-with-vagrant/)

In short just use the Vagrant file in the repo and run

```vagrant up
```

```vagrant ssh
```

```startxfce4&
```
